Girl Script Winter Mentorship: Web Development Track

<b> Introduction </b>

This mentorship programme will focus on how web pages are created and developed from scratch, we will primarily be covering the basics of what every web developer should know: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

There are no prerequisites for this course, it is for absolute beginners; any prior experience with programming is a plus. 

Each week we will cover one of the above mentioned languages and in Week 4, we will focus on making a group project that encompasses all the concepts you learn in this programme.

There will be three weekly tasks and the third task in each week will be a small project submission, the code for which will be uploaded by each mentee on the Mentorship Programme GitHub repository.

Comments: 

*I personally strongly recommend completing Week 1 from the Coursera Course linked to in [3]. It covers all the basics of HTML. 

*W3 consortium webpage recommends a <a href = "https://www.wpkube.com/html5-cheat-sheet/">cheat sheet</a> for the HTML tags (found via <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/html/supplement/z5gD8/cheatsheets">Coursera</a>). This is good for beginners, donâ€™t grow dependent on it.

*Watch <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnTQVlqmDQ0&t=90s">this</a> YouTube video to find out what technologies you want to explore beyond this mentorship programme.

*Keep in mind: Learn by writing the code, when you go through a concept or a new tag on w3schools, practice and write the code. One good website to do this for basics is <a href = "https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/say-hello-to-html-elements">freeCodeCamp</a>.
